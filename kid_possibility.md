# Kid Possibility

Kid Possibility is a Non-Profit 501(c)3 for the development of
possibility in kids.

Kid Possibility strives to allow children to really GET that anything
is possible….they can do anything.

We strive to break down and remove those limitations that creep in
with age, any age – those that society instills, those that humans,
including kids, put on themselves when something didn’t work out the
first time or when they listened to someone who said it was not
possible.

If not you then who!

Kid Possibility creates experiences that are designed to transcend and
transform limiting self-thought.

Our only requirement is that the kids want to do this and agree to
fully participate in the activities. This does not work if it is the
parent driving (and at worst forcing) their participation. If you are
a parent and you want your kid to be a part of this, we are happy to
talk with your child and help your them discover and say for
themselves might get out of this.

Activities vary with seasons, availability, and interest. They may
include:

Rock climbing

No-Drop bike rides. How would it be if a kid could ride 25, 50, or
even 100 miles in a day?

Skiing – learn to
