title: Andrew Vanis

I am a first-generation American. I was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia
(now the Czech Republic). When I was eight years old, my mother
escaped with me and my brother and her second husband from that
Eastern block country.

We came to the US in 1980, the day Ronald Reagan was elected. My first
English words were learned on the plane over. Those words were “I am
hungry.” Those words are still appropriate to me not only because I
really do enjoy a good meal, be it simple or gourmet, but that I
realize that I have been and still am hungry for accomplishment.

I believe the main influence in striving for accomplishment is the
influence of my mother. Just think, a woman around thirty years old
dragging along two kids 8 and 10, comes to a new country not knowing
the language so her kids can have a better life. First she takes a job
refinishing furniture. With much effort and gumption, she applies her
art training and talent to not just get a job but also to get
freelance work. She goes on to create identities for companies from
the US government to Hostess. You can see some of her work here -

is my favorite and I still remember in grade school staying up late
with her as she was working on this -

Little did I know the full impact of this specific message.

In August 1986, less than six years later after arriving in the US, my
mother worked and saved enough to buy a house in a good school
district so my brother and I could have a good high school experience
and be properly prepared for college. To start with nothing and having
two kids to raise to boot, and still in a short time buying a house,
what a great accomplishment! I am proud of her.

# Career

## Financial Advisor

Joined Morgan Stanley in 2012. They like to control their message so
Google me and them for the official message. My favorite part of this
are the client interaction, educating them, and helping them figure
out what life goals they are investing for. I work with an excellent
team.

## Problem solver

This is probably my most fun area -figuring out how to get things done
and getting them done. I like the challenge of taking on the difficult
and I love the satisfaction of doing something that someone else
thought not possible. What I have found was that, in general, it just
takes time and effort to reach the solution. Luck does help too.

## Investor

I have been involved with residential and commercial real estate
ventures and hold a small portfolio of properties. I have been lucky
that I have had long term tenants for a while and I hope it stays that
way. My tenants say they like having me as a landlord. I take that as
a compliment and am grateful they prove it by staying as my tenants.
If you want to ask them yourself, you can find their addresses at
www.99houses.com. On that page you can also see some of the rehabs I
have done.

Also, I have looked into ventures outside of real estate. None have
struck me yet but I really enjoyed looking into new compressed natural
gas tank technology for vehicles – www.angtanks.com. I had high hopes
for this tech since I “got it” due to my science background and
interests and most importantly I might have had a change to work with
David Pape, a man I respect and admire greatly. I still have a single
cab CNG truck that I love for its technology even though it is in no
way practical for my family of four and our three dogs.

## Real Estate Broker – Commercial

I enjoyed being a broker and got to work on some satisfying and large
deals but it was all crushed one day when a successful, though not
respectable, investor I was making a presentation to said “Well if
it’s such a good deal why don’t you buy it.” I have been focusing on
investments since.

## Real Estate Agent – Residential

While in college, I got my real estate license as soon as possible
at 21. On the hundred-plus question licensing test I got all answers
correct but one and while in college started practicing RE in my small
college town of 12,500 people. I had nine closing in my first six
months. Then, my broker asked me to find a different office because
the other agents were uncomfortable about me. Devastating at the time
but redeeming a few years later when the same broker said he should
not have done that since the same agents did not work out in the long
run anyway. Real Estate was in my blood.

## Sales manager

Eventually I managed the Northern California sales for a national
portrait studio. This company brought their photo studios to grocery
and other types of stores and provided high volume lower cost
portraits. My team had the highest sales averages and I received
several awards.

It all started in high school when my mom met a man, to whom she has
been married since – congrats mom!, who worked for such a company. He
started his own company and let me help run it. I was such a basket
case at first but then I got the hang of it. Back then I still
stuttered a lot in uncomfortable situations so I stuttered a lot with
the first customers. Also, I talked really fast. One of the first
people was jovial but he did ask if I was on drugs. Great, and funny,
learning experience.

I did this through community college and then started with the
national company when I went on to undergraduate and also did this
when starting in real estate. I did the photo sales job full time
after my residential broker asked me to find a different office, see
“Real Estate Agent – Residential” above.

All this sales acumen started in junior high. I worked on a crew that
sold products in the suburbs of Chicago made by blind folks at the
Lighthouse for the Blind. I did this for several years and was the top
sales kid most days. We only worked on Saturday and we got to keep 10%
of sales. It was common for me to come home with $100-$150 and
sometimes $200 for one days of work. Pretty good for a 7th grader in
1985.

# Activities

## Hang Gliding

My biggest obsession for the last 8 years. Contrary to what most think
it is not an adrenaline sport, for me at least. It is the challenge of
going far, and sometimes really far, just on air currents that you
can’t see. It is the one case where being a bird brain is a good
thing. Every time up is a learning experience, be it the
interpretation of the weather, the details of the terrain that
generates the lift, or of the self - how I prepared, how I am handling
the flight, how I’m handling almost sinking out, how I can keep myself
going even if I’m really tired, how to keep my head on the task, how
to always look for that other way out if the current plan starts going
sideways.

## Skiing

I love to ski and the thing that always keeps it interesting is the
pursuit of the perfect carve. The shaped skis make that easier but the
weighing fore/aft, hand position, etc. still make noticeable
differences and I am blessed that I can recognize those differences.

I skied a little in the Czech Republic and was heartbroken when the
new skis I got were left behind when we escaped. I did not ski much
then until I could drive. Then I skied 70+ days some years by
arranging my school schedule to start at 7am, finished by 2pm, driving
an hour and a half to 298 foot www.wilmotmountain.com skiing form 4pm
to 11pm, driving home and doing it again the next day. I got myself on
the local youth ski team by offering the team photos – see later part
of Sales Manager section above – and continued racing through college.
I got the furthest of all our college team when we went to the
regional race only to miss my second run to a chairlift malfunction.
It happens…

I taught both of my kids to ski when 2 years old. They are good at it
and they enjoy it very much. Now I coach a ski racing team and
instruct people to get to have this exceptional experience.

## Kayaking

I loved this sport, so fluid, so much working with currents. Very much
like hang gliding in that way. I have not Kayaked much since coming to
NM but when in Oregon It was my new skill set. One of the things I
most enjoyed was entering the water from a riverside rock. It was
almost like flying. The other significant thing I learned was not to
be afraid of the rocks underneath. It was very much a mental
roadblock. When I started, I was very worried I would hit one with my
face when I was flipped over. The way I overcame it was by reasoning
that if I kept my head to my boat when over I would just bound off of
them- this also happened to be the right position to set up for a
roll. I finally flipped over on purpose before a shallow section,
bounced off a few rocks, rolled back up and have not had that issue
since. I still consider it a potential danger but that irrational fear
is gone.

## Windsurfing

I LOVED windsurfing. Also another thing I have not done since moving
to NM. I started before I could drive so thanks mom for driving me
around. Long story but the think I enjoyed working on the most was
getting that perfect jibe. It is very much like the carve in skiing
with the weighting of the board. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I
still feel like I have a lot to learn, especially on the “Oregon side”
jibe. The college ski team and the proximity to the Columbia Gorge
helped make my decision to finish my undergrad in Oregon. It has not
been lost on me that the windsurfing sail is basically on half of a
hang gliding wing.

## Rock Climbing

## Cycling

## Sailing

## Motorcycle

## VW Vanagon

My adventure vessel. Have is set up for both summer and winter
adventures. And it let’s me tinker and design. www.SuperVanagon.com

# Family

## Mirek Vanis

Mirek is now (1/2019) in 2nd year at Pitzer College studying math
after graduating early. He is so bright. And so AWESOME!!! He has
embraced the love of the outdoors and is an spectacular rafter,
kayaker, skier, rock climber. He has a personality that draws people
to him and he is seen as a leader. I am very proud of him!

(The following is an earlier version, don’t even remember when I wrote
it) Mirek is a great kid with a great outlook to whom good things seem
to happen to out of the blue. I hope this continues for him in his
life, even though it does make me a little jealous. I am concluding
that this ease of life is a result of his outlook and attitude so in
my base belief that we call all learn something to at least some
degree I am watching and trying to emulate his relaxed (but still
intense) attitude. Mirek is more like his mom and I really enjoy the
times Mirek and I can connect. It is not as easy for me as with Avalon
but It is really important to me so I try as best I can. He is
teaching me a lot! Too often I am harder on him that I intend and I am
working on identifying those situations. As all humans Mirek has many
fine qualities. The one that stands out for me is his drive. If he is
after a ball in Soccer or after getting his gymnastics routine figured
out he is driven after it. And all this while having a great time.

## Avalon Vanis www.AvalonVanis.com

Avalon…Amazing!..even if she has some teenager happening ;-) 1/2019
she is in her Junior year and will graduate early. She is bright in so
many ways. As a high school freshman she took a college statistics
course over summer and got the highest grade in the class. Avalon is
very compassionate and empathetic. She loves animals and has 3 dogs!

(The following is an earlier version, don’t even remember when I wrote
it) Avalon is much more like me in attitude so we can connect very
easily. She might be the most comfortable person in the world for me
to be around and for that I am very delighted. I hope that feeling
stays as time goes on. She’s a delight, creative, has initiative, and
very expressively caring. She’s way into animals and is the reason we
have three dogs, a bird, and a frog.
