Goodman Realty Group, Albuquerque, NM and Chicago, IL www.goodmanrealty.com

 

Financing / Analysis - I have analyzed the following during the acquisition and financing process: • Rent rolls • CAM provisions, audits • Environmental assessments

Percentage rent • TI histories • Operating statements • Income projections

 

In 2001 we purchased Montgomery Plaza, the largest strip center in the New Mexico. To facilitate financing we split the property into two parts. One part includes the parcels with higher occupation and credit tenants and the other the lower occupancy and lower credit tenants. The first has conduit financing at better terms with earn outs. The second had conventional local financing. The leasing increases and the operation cost reduction we accomplished in part one, would allow us to pay off part two using the 2002 earn out proceeds.

 

In 2002 we purchased the Sun Health Care world headquarters that is now called Sun Plaza One and Two — the two most advanced and architecturally interesting office buildings in New Mexico. One was a six-story shell building. Two is a smaller building fully occupied by Sun Health Care. These buildings were purchased while Sun was in bankruptcy thus our structured financing required interest reserves in addition to TI and leasing reserves.  Both have been since leased by Northrop Grumman and the national office of the US Forrest Service.

 

Property Management — I worked with the following on a daily basis and have a thorough understanding of a property’s operation structure

• tenant relations • budget creation • tenant and center remodel / construction design

• lease analysis, creation, negotiation • vendor management, administration, selection, contracts

 

We implemented electric and water operations savings of at least 50% at Montgomery Plaza. I helped create in-house landscaping, maintenance, and HVAC companies to provide better lower-cost services to all our seven local properties. I helped create the New Mexico office to run these properties including the office move and build out, personnel hire and training, and infrastructure implementation.
