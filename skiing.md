'Last week I attended an advanced clinic Level 5/6 with a Level 4 instructor in Revelstoke, Canada and while it was great I am reminded of the one day I skied with Andy Vanis in March 2018 in Wolf Creek, Colorado. The lesson with Andy was much better. Not only can Andy ski extremely well he is also a very skilled instructor. I would recommend him to any ski team or private students.'
